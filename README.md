<h1>Code Quiz</h1>

This week's homework is to build a timed multiple-choice code quiz used with HTML, Bootstrap and JavaScript. 

User will be greeted with a blue button to start their quiz. Once they press the button, the timer will start running down from 75 seconds. If the user answers the question correctly, they will receive 10 points and a 5 second increase to their time. If they selected an incorrect answer, 10 seconds will be docked from their timer. Once the user has completed all questions, they will be notified of their total score.
